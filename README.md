<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Minhaj Sordar</h1>
<h3 align="center">MERN Stack Web Developer</h3>

<p>
I'm a highly experienced full-stack developer specializing in building scalable, high-performance web and desktop applications. With expertise in **Next.js, React, Electron.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**, I develop dynamic platforms, ERP solutions, and data-driven applications that enhance business efficiency.
<br/>
  I've worked extensively on:
<br/>
✔ ERP management systems using Electron.js & local databases for offline support.
<br/>
✔ Funnel websites & SaaS platforms with subdomain automation & custom domain integration.
<br/>
✔ Vue.js & Quasar-powered dashboards with efficient data handling.
<br/>
✔ Secure & scalable backend systems with JWT authentication, file uploads, and data synchronization.
<br/>
✔ Server & DevOps management, handling VPS setup, database administration (MongoDB & MySQL), and AWS/GCP services.
<br/>

Beyond development, I enjoy problem-solving, optimizing application performance, and ensuring seamless user experiences.
